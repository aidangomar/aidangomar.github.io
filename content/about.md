Hi, I'm Aidan. I'm interested in distributed systems and databases. 

Currently, I work on infrastructure at LanceDB. In the past, I've worked on AWS at Amazon, scripting & automation at a bank, and IT work for an IT contractor.

I study Computer Science at McGill University in Montreal, QC.

I'm a classically trained violist and enjoy playing string quartet music, reading philosophy, and playing poker.
